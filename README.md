# IOIP-in-Saturated-Reservoir

### Description
This project is based on Basic Reservoir Engineering concept which is MBAL. The concept that we take is to determine Initial Oil in Place (IOIP) with Material Balance (MBAL) equations with the case is in Saturated Reservoir (no gas cap and no water drive). For this project is still not clear but it will be updated later

### Requirements
- The data
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
